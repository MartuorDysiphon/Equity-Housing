Inspiration Behind This Project

I was inspired to redesign Equity Housingâ€™s website because I believe their student accommodation deserves a modern, easy-to-use online presence. While the real Equity Housing site exists, I felt I could create a version that better reflects the quality, safety, and community they provide for students. Unfortunately, I was never given the chance to officially build it, so this redesign is purely a personal project.

Disclaimer

This is not the official Equity Housing website.
You can visit the real one at ðŸ‘‰ equityhousing.com

All logos limited to the ones I redesigned, property photos, and original artwork used here belong to Equity Housing and are sourced directly from their official website. This project is simply a redesign concept created by Katlego MJ for educational and portfolio purposes.
